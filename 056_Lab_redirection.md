# Lab: Redirecting Standard Output and Standard Error
```sh
# navigate to your home directory, verfy with pwd
# 1. Create a directory for this lab(_yourname_dir01):
# 2. List the contents of a non-existent directory to generate an error and redirect the error to a file called `error.txt`:
# 3. List the contents of your current directory and redirect the output to a file called `output.txt`:
# 4. List the contents of the root directory and append the output to a file called `output.txt`:
# 5. Run a command that produces both output and an error, redirecting both to a single file called `combined.txt`:(example: ls ~ /invalid/dir/path)
# 6. View the contents of each file to verify the results: "cat error.txt combined.txt output.txt" #!SS send screenshot
